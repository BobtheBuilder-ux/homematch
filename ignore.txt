You are designing a responsive “Coming Soon” landing page for Homematch — a Nigerian rental platform that connects tenants directly with landlords, removing agent fees, fake listings, and wasted trips.  

🔹 REQUIREMENTS:
1. The landing page should have two separate pages or sections:
   - Page 1: Tenants
   - Page 2: Landlords
   - Each page should have its own targeted pain-point hooks and call-to-action.
   - Each page should link to its own survey form.

2. Branding:
   - Brand name: Homematch
   - Color scheme: Use project color template
3. Tenant Page Structure:
   - Headline: “House Hunting in Nigeria is Broken. Let’s Fix It Together.”
   - Subheadline: “No more fake listings. No more outrageous agent fees. No more wasted trips.”
   - Bullet list of relatable tenant pain points.
   - Call-to-action button: “I’m a Tenant – Start Survey”
   - Embedded Tenant Survey with:
       a) Radio buttons
       b) Multi-select checkboxes
       c) Short answer fields
       d) Dropdowns where applicable
     (Use the exact tenant survey questions and options from the provided list above.)

4. Landlord Page Structure:
   - Headline: “Finding Good Tenants Shouldn’t Be This Hard. Let’s Change That.”
   - Subheadline: “No more unreliable agents. No more empty apartments. No more late rent headaches.”
   - Bullet list of relatable landlord pain points.
   - Call-to-action button: “I’m a Landlord – Start Survey”
   - Embedded Landlord Survey with:
       a) Radio buttons
       b) Multi-select checkboxes
       c) Short answer fields
       d) Dropdowns where applicable
     (Use the exact landlord survey questions and options from the provided list above.)

5. Functionality:
   - Surveys should have a progress indicator.
   - Each survey ends with “Would you like to be notified when we launch?” (Yes/No + Email input).
   - On submit, show a thank-you message: “Thanks for sharing your feedback! We’ll notify you when Homematch launches.”
   - Store survey responses in a database (or Google Sheets) for later review.

6. Style:
   - Mobile-first responsive design.
   - White card-style form containers with subtle shadow.
   - Large, accessible buttons.
   - Progressively reveal questions (one section at a time) to improve completion rates.

GOAL:
We want to launch this “Coming Soon” page to collect real feedback from tenants and landlords in Nigeria before launching Homematch.
